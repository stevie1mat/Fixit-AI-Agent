# Fix It AI - E-commerce Assistant

**Fix It AI** is an intelligent assistant that helps you manage and improve your online store without needing to be a technical expert. Think of it as having a smart developer on your team who can understand what you want in plain English and make the changes for you.

## What This Tool Does (In Simple Terms)

- **Talks to Your Store**: Connects to your Shopify or WordPress website
- **Understands You**: You can tell it what you want in normal language (like "make my products look better" or "speed up my website")
- **Shows You First**: Before making any changes, it shows you exactly what will happen
- **Makes It Safe**: You can test changes without breaking your live store
- **Keeps Track**: Remembers everything it does so you can undo changes if needed

## Why Use Fix It AI?

Running an online store can be complicated. You might want to:
- Fix slow loading pages
- Improve how your products look
- Add special discounts for customers
- Make your site easier to find on Google
- Update product information quickly

Usually, these tasks require hiring a developer or learning complex technical skills. Fix It AI does all of this for you by simply chatting with an AI assistant.

## üöÄ Key Features Explained

### ü§ñ Smart Chat Interface
**What it does**: You can talk to the AI assistant like you're texting a friend who knows everything about websites.

**How it works**:
- **Natural Language Processing**: Instead of learning complex commands, just say "make my checkout page faster" or "add a sale badge to discounted products"
- **Streaming Responses**: The AI types back to you in real-time, so you can see it thinking and working
- **Context Awareness**: The AI remembers your store's setup and gives suggestions that actually work for your specific situation

**Example**: Instead of learning how to edit code, you just say "I want all my sale items to have a red 'SALE' badge" and the AI figures out how to make it happen.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started - Step by Step Guide

### What You'll Need Before Starting

**Technical Requirements** (Don't worry, we'll explain each one):
- **Node.js 18+**: This is the programming language that runs the application. Think of it as the engine that makes everything work.
- **npm**: This is a package manager that helps install all the tools the app needs to run.
- **Grok API key**: This is your key to use the AI assistant. It's like a password that lets the app talk to the AI.
- **Store credentials**: You'll need access to your Shopify store or WordPress website.

### Step 1: Download and Set Up the Application

**1.1 Download the code**
```bash
# Copy this command and run it in your terminal/command prompt
git clone <repository-url>
cd fixit-ai
```

**What this does**: Downloads all the code files to your computer and moves you into the project folder.

**1.2 Install all the required tools**
```bash
npm install
```

**What this does**: Downloads all the software libraries and tools that the application needs to work. This might take a few minutes.

**Why it's needed**: Just like you need to install apps on your phone, this app needs to install its "helper apps" to work properly.

### Step 2: Configure Your Settings

**2.1 Create your settings file**
```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

**What this does**: Creates a settings file where you'll put your personal information (like passwords and API keys).

**2.2 Edit your settings file**

Open the `.env.local` file in any text editor and fill in your information:

```env
# Database (This is where the app stores information)
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# AI API Key (This lets the app use the AI assistant)
GROK_API_KEY="your-grok-api-key-here"

# Shopify Store Settings (If you're using Shopify)
SHOPIFY_STORE_URL="your-shopify-store.myshopify.com"
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-shopify-access-token"

# WordPress Settings (If you're using WordPress)
WP_BASE_URL="https://your-wordpress-site.com"
WP_USERNAME="your-wordpress-username"
WP_APP_PASSWORD="your-wordpress-app-password"
```

**Important**: Replace the example values with your actual information. Don't share these with anyone!

### Step 3: Set Up the Database

**3.1 Generate the database structure**
```bash
npm run db:generate
```

**What this does**: Creates the database structure that the app needs to store information.

**3.2 Create the database**
```bash
npm run db:push
```

**What this does**: Actually creates the database file on your computer.

**Why it's needed**: The app needs somewhere to store information about changes it makes, user settings, and other data.

### Step 4: Start the Application

**4.1 Start the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**What this does**: Starts the application and makes it available on your computer.

**4.2 Open your web browser**
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

**What this means**: 
- `localhost` means "this computer"
- `3000` is the port number (like a specific door to your application)
- You should see the Fix It AI interface in your browser

### Step 5: Connect Your Store

Once the application is running, you'll need to connect it to your Shopify store or WordPress website. The app will guide you through this process, but you'll need the credentials we mentioned in Step 2.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**If the app won't start:**
- Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 18 or higher)
- Check that all the commands completed without errors
- Try running `npm install` again

**If you can't connect to your store:**
- Double-check your API keys and credentials
- Make sure your store is accessible from the internet
- Verify that you have the correct permissions set up

**If you see error messages:**
- Check the terminal/command prompt for specific error details
- Make sure all required fields in `.env.local` are filled out
- Try restarting the application

## üîß Detailed Configuration Guide

### Setting Up Shopify Connection

**What you need to do**: Give Fix It AI permission to access your Shopify store so it can make changes for you.

**Step-by-step process**:

**1. Create a Private App in Shopify**
- Log into your Shopify admin panel
- Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Apps and sales channels**
- Click **Develop apps** (at the bottom)
- Click **Create an app**
- Give it a name like "Fix It AI Assistant"
- Click **Create app**

**2. Set Up Permissions (Scopes)**
This tells Shopify what the app is allowed to do. You need to enable these permissions:

- **Products**: `read_products, write_products (read and write product information)`
- **Themes**: `read_themes, write_themes` (modify your store's appearance)
- **Shipping**: `read_shipping, write_shipping` (manage shipping settings)
- **Discounts**: `read_discounts, write_discounts` (create and manage discounts)
- **Metafields**: `read_metafields, write_metafields` (add custom product information)

**How to enable permissions**:

- Scroll down to **Admin API access scopes**
- Check the boxes for all the permissions listed above
- Click **Save**

**3. Get Your Access Token**

- Click **Install app** (this activates the permissions)
- Copy the **Admin API access token**
- Paste this token into your `.env.local` file as `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`

**4. Add Your Store URL**

- Add this to your `.env.local` file as `SHOPIFY_STORE_URL`

### Setting Up WordPress Connection

**What you need to do**: Give Fix It AI permission to access your WordPress website so it can make changes.

**Step-by-step process**:

**1. Enable REST API (Usually Already Enabled)**

- If you're not sure, ask your hosting provider or developer

**2. Create an Application Password**
This is a special password that lets the app access your WordPress site safely.

- Log into your WordPress admin dashboard
- Go to **Users** ‚Üí **Profile** (or **Users** ‚Üí **All Users** ‚Üí click your username)
- Scroll down to **Application Passwords** section
- In the **Application Name** field, type "Fix It AI"
- Click **Add New Application Password**
- **Important**: Copy the password immediately - you won't be able to see it again!
- Add this password to your `.env.local` file as `WP_APP_PASSWORD`

**3. Add Your WordPress Details**
- Your WordPress username (the one you use to log in)
- Your WordPress site URL (like `https://yourwebsite.com`)
- Add these to your `.env.local` file

### Setting Up Grok AI API

**What you need to do**: Get access to the AI assistant that powers Fix It AI.

**Step-by-step process**:

**1. Sign Up for Grok API**
- Visit the Grok API website
- Create an account (you'll need to provide some basic information)
- Choose a plan that fits your needs (there's usually a free tier to start)

**2. Get Your API Key**
- Log into your Grok API dashboard
- Look for **API Keys** or **Credentials** section
- Click **Generate New Key** or **Create API Key**
- Give it a name like "Fix It AI Integration"
- Copy the key immediately - you won't be able to see it again!

**3. Add to Your Settings**
- Add the API key to your `.env.local` file as `GROK_API_KEY`

### Understanding the Settings File

**What is `.env.local`?**
This is a special file that stores your personal settings and passwords. It's like a notebook where you write down all the keys and passwords the app needs.

**Important Security Notes**:
- Never share this file with anyone
- Don't upload it to public websites or GitHub
- Keep it on your computer only
- If someone gets access to this file, they could access your stores

**What each setting does**:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Tells the app where to store its data
- `GROK_API_KEY`: Lets the app use the AI assistant
- `SHOPIFY_STORE_URL`: Your Shopify store address
- `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Permission to access your Shopify store
- `WP_BASE_URL`: Your WordPress website address
- `WP_USERNAME`: Your WordPress login username
- `WP_APP_PASSWORD`: Special password for the app to access WordPress

### Testing Your Connections

**After setting everything up, you can test if it's working**:

1. Start the application (`npm run dev`)
2. Open the app in your browser
3. Look for connection test buttons or status indicators
4. The app should show "Connected" or "Ready" for each service you've configured

**If something isn't working**:
- Double-check all your credentials
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in your settings
- Verify that your API keys are still valid
- Check that your store/website is accessible from the internet

## üÜò Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Application Won't Start

**Problem**: You run `npm run dev` but nothing happens or you get an error.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Node.js version**: Run `node --version` in your terminal. You need version 18 or higher.
   - If you have an older version, download the latest from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. **Clear npm cache**: Run `npm cache clean --force`
3. **Delete node_modules**: Delete the `node_modules` folder and run `npm install` again
4. **Check for port conflicts**: Make sure nothing else is using port 3000
   - Try `npm run dev -- -p 3001` to use a different port

### Database Issues

**Problem**: You get database-related errors when starting the app.

**Solutions**:
1. **Regenerate the database**: Run `npm run db:generate` then `npm run db:push`
2. **Check database file permissions**: Make sure the app can read and write to the database file
3. **Reset the database**: Delete the `dev.db` file and run the database commands again

### Connection Problems

**Problem**: The app can't connect to your Shopify store or WordPress site.

**Shopify Connection Issues**:
- **Check your store URL**: Make sure it's exactly `your-store.myshopify.com` (no https://)
- **Verify access token**: Make sure you copied the entire token without extra spaces
- **Check permissions**: Ensure all required scopes are enabled in your Shopify app
- **Test the connection**: Try visiting `https://your-store.myshopify.com/admin/api/2023-10/products.json` in your browser (replace with your store URL)

**WordPress Connection Issues**:
- **Check your site URL**: Make sure it includes `https://` and doesn't end with a slash
- **Verify application password**: Make sure you copied the entire password correctly
